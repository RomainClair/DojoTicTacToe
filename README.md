# Tic Tac Toe

## Skills & concepts

* Use array
* Model a problem using a basic class
* Use class constants

## Goals

Write a src/TicTacToeBoard class with a state() method.
This method returns :

* a PLAYER_1 constant (value 1) if the first player won
* a PLAYER_2 constant (value 2) if the second player won
* a IN_PROGRESS constant (value 0) if the game is still not decided
* a DRAW_GAME constant (value -1) if the board is full with no winner.

The tictactoe.php script can be completed to test your class
